# Styling React Components
> :mortar_board: Notes based on [this Pluralsight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-components-styling/table-of-contents)

Different approaches for styling React components include:
1. [Inline styling](#one-inline-styling)
1. [CSS-in-JS libraries](#two-css-in-js-libraries)
1. [Traditional CSS stylesheets](#three-traditional-css-stylesheets)
1. [CSS modules](#four-css-modules)

:point_right: For example implementations of each of these, see [the first 4 directories in this repo](https://github.com/jaketrent/styling-react-components). -- A **5th option**, not mentioned in the above course, consists of [adding SASS stylesheets](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet), which does enable you to share variables between your stylesheets.

## :one: Inline styling
- allows encapsulating style information along with the logic and markup
- achieved by using `style` attributes in the markup, with the actual styles supplied as a JS object:
  ```js
  const styles = {
    color: 'white',
    background: 'blue',
    padding: '0.5rem 1rem',
    borderRadius: '2px'
  };
  
  <button style={styles}>Click me</button>
  ```
  > :zap: Notice camel case names rather than dashes!

:smile: **Other benefits:**
- Easy code sharing as styles are written in JS
- Styles are isolated (not polluting the global CSS namespace)
- Dependencies on the styles are clear, as either appear side-by-side with the styles themselves or are marked by explicit imports
- No library required

:disappointed: **Disadvantages:**
- unable to override styles without use of `!important` due to inline styles' priority in the cascade
- No media queries
- Pseudo selectors aren't available
- No keyframe animations
-> All of these would have to be handled through JavaScript instead

> :pencil: **Verdict:** This approach is good if you have relatively simple style requirements, prefer co-locating your styles with your components and want to avoid having to use any libraries for styling. It's very JavaScript-centric and is regarded by some as a version of CSS-in-JS.

## :two: CSS-in-JS libraries
- many conceptual overlaps with inline styling, but uses styling library to achieve the same goals
- the library adds features and properties that would usually be achieved in CSS itself
- many libraries available: `styled-components`, `emotion`, `aphrodite`, `glamor`, `styled-jsx`, `radium`, `astroturf`...
- some libraries use JS object syntax, whilst others emulate CSS syntax

### Example: [styled-components :nail_care:](https://styled-components.com/)
- uses CSS syntax via tagged template literals
- creates new React components bound to defined styles

:smile: **Benefits:**
- supports media queries, pseudo selectors, keyframe animations and dynamic styles
- co-located styles and code

```js
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
  color: white;
  background: ${props => props.secondary ? 'gray' : 'blue'};
  border-radius: 2px;
  
  @media (min-width: 800px) {
    border-radius: 3px;
  }
  
  &:hover {
    outline: 2px solid white;
  }
`

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button>Already styled</Button>
  )
}
```

:disappointed: **Disadvantages:**
- choosing a library
- as class names are usually generated by the library, writing overrides is still tricky

> :pencil: **Verdict:** This approach is good if you value co-locating your styles with your components and want to use the full power of CSS, through a more robust toolset than with plain inline styles.

</br>


## :three: Traditional CSS stylesheets
I.e.:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/my-styles.css" />
```

:smile: **Benefits:**
- no new syntax to learn
- full power of CSS available

:disappointed: **Disadvantages:**
- global namespace with poor isolation (styles not bound to components in any way), which easily results in unexpected overrides
- unclear dependencies make code elimination hard

> :pencil: **Verdict:** This approach is good if you feel at home in CSS and don't want to introduce a new process.

</br>


## :four: CSS modules
- Feels similar to traditional stylesheets (you write CSS in a `.css` file)
- But files are called 'modules' and are not `<link />`ed directly in the html
- Instead, they rely on a CSS build step using a Module Bundler (such as Webpack), and are imported into your components, e.g. `import '../App.css'`
- Use the `some-styles.module.css` naming convention to tell React that the file imported is not an ordinary stylesheet, but a CSS module - which will be treated differently by the bundler than the general (see [docs for further detail](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet)!)

> :bulb: With modules, it's possible to import and use specific exports, e.g.:
```js
import React from 'react';
import * as css from './component-styles.module.css';

function MyComponent() {
  return <button className={css.button}>Click me</button>
}
```

:smile: **Benefits:**
- When compiled, module selectors become hashed and thus isolated to specific components, so no longer risk of global collision / accidental overrides
- Full power of CSS
- Explicit dependencies due to clear imports (making dead code elimination easier)

:disappointed: **Disadvantages:**
- intentional overrides require creating an abstraction layer in JS (or using a library like `react-css-themr`)
- sharing code / constants is not possible :C


> :pencil: **Verdict:** This approach is good if you want to keep using CSS stylesheets but manage some of the problems inherent in traditional CSS.
