## ASP.NET vs ASP.NET Core
![Architecture overview](/img/net-core-vs-old-net.png)

**ASP.NET Core** allows to build web applications that can run on Windows, macOS, or Linux. It offers higher performance than ASP.NET 4.x. and uses the .NET Core runtime (as opposed to .NET Framework). It shares a lot of ASP.NET's features and concepts, such as controllers, action methods and [Razor](#razor--mvc), but also add further features, e.g. [Tag Helpers](#tag-helpers), built-in [dependency injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-2.2), and shifts to a [Middleware](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/?view=aspnetcore-2.2)-centric approach.

## Basic Setup
ASP.NET is Microsoft's technology for running dynamic web pages on web servers. ASP.NET Razor is a server-side markup language that lets you embed server-based (C#) code into web pages.

### Controllers & Default Routing
**Controllers** are classes whose names have to end in `...Controller`, and which inherit from the `System.Web.Mvc.Controller` base class.

Controllers have one or more **action methods**, which typically return one of the MVC *action result types*, which derive from the [ActionResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.mvc.actionresult?view=aspnet-mvc-5.2) class (= the base class for all `*Result` classes); the return type of action methods is therefore usually `ActionResult` or one of its derived types.

> :point_right: Both controllers and action methods need to be public.

By default, the **routing** created by MVC for pages is `~/controllerName/actionName`, for example:

```c#
public class ComicBookController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult Detail()
    {
        return Content("Hello!");
    }
}
```

- this page (resource) will be associated with the path `~/ComicBook/Detail`.
- `Content()` is a handy `Controller` method that returns a new `ContentResult`, which is one of the derived types of `ActionResult`

The **Homepage** (i.e. start page without additional path) is by default associated with `HomeController` -> `Index()`. (NB: For any other `HomeController` action methods, `Home` has to be spelled out in the path.)

Generally, omitting the `actionName` part of any path will associate the request with the controller's `Index()` action method.

#### Where are routes defined?
The routes for an ASP.NET MVC website or application are defined by adding a series of rules to the `RouteCollection` object in the order that they should be applied to incoming requests. Typically these are defined in the `RouteConfig.cs` and executed in the `Global.asax` file.

> :sparkles: For more detail on controller routing in **ASP.NET Core** specifically, see [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/routing?view=aspnetcore-2.2). :sparkles:

### Views & ViewBag
In the MVC paradigm for ASP.NET, the *controller* is combined with the *view* to create a 'page'. MVC provides the [`ViewResult`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.mvc.viewresult?view=aspnet-mvc-5.2) action result type for returning views from an action method. The corresponding controller method is `View()`:

```c#
public class ComicBookController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult Detail()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```
- :grey_exclamation: By default, this will make MVC look in the `~/Views/ComicBook/` and `~/Views/Shared/` directories for a template file called `Detail`.
- By convention, all views are kept in the `Views` folder.
- It is however possible to explicitely request a view that doesn't follow these conventions from the controller action method.

#### Strongly typed views
A *strongly typed view* is an MVC view that is associated with a specific type.

##### In the controller:
Create an actual instance of the model and pass this into the call to `View()` (or other result type) in the relevant action method, i.e. `View(modelInstance)`.

> :+1: *Constructing and filling the model, and then passing it along to the view, is a classic controller job.*

##### In the view: 
* To define which class to use as a model, add a *model view directive* to the top of the view, using the fully qualified namespace of model:
    ```c#
    @model ProjectName.Models.ModelName
    ```
* A strongly typed view exposes the model instance (i.e. that was passed in from the controller) through the view's `Model` property; so you can access the model's properties via `Model.PropertyName`.

#### ViewBag
`ViewBag` is an object of type [dynamic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/using-type-dynamic) provided by MVC that allows us to pass data from a controller to a view. It is available as a property on both views as well as controllers. The following example dynamically creates & sets two new `ViewBag` properties, `Id` and `Description`.

```c#
public ActionResult Detail()
{
    ViewBag.Id = 123;
    ViewBag.Description = "";
    return View();
}
```
-> These two datapoints can then be accessed in the template:

```html
<h1>Product @ViewBag.Id</h1>
<h2>Description: @ViewBag.Description</h2>
```
##### Use cases of `ViewBag`
> :point_right: As a rule of thumb, you’ll use the `ViewData` object for the purposes of transporting **small amounts of data from and to specific locations** (e.g., controller to view or between views). If you need to work with larger amounts of data, use **dedicated view model** objects instead.

_________________________

## Razor Views & Layouts
Razor is a markup syntax that lets you embed server-based code (Visual Basic and C#) into web pages. It can be seen as an evolution of the old “.aspx” style markup.

ASP.NET MVC has implemented a view engine that allows us to use Razor inside of an MVC application to produce HTML. 

Razor can either be used as part of a classic MVC-structured application, or as part of an *MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)* setup, whereby the model and controller code is also included within the Razor Page itself. For more on the differences between these, see: https://stackify.com/asp-net-razor-pages-vs-mvc/.


### Basic Syntax
> :point_right: Super handy reference: **[C# Razor Syntax Quick Reference](https://haacked.com/archive/2011/01/06/razor-syntax-quick-reference.aspx/)**

1. Add code to a page using the `@` character: it starts inline expressions, single statement blocks, and multi-statement blocks
1. Single or multi-statement code blocks are enclosed in braces, each statement ending on a semicolon
1. Expressions don't require braces or semicolons (if Razor gets confused about longer expressions, you can wrap them in parenthesis: `@(...)`)
1. Variables can be used to store values

```cshtml
<!-- Single statement block  -->
@{ var myMessage = "Hello World"; }

<!-- Inline expressions -->
<p>The value of myMessage is: @myMessage</p>
<p>myMessage contains @(myMessage.StartsWith("Hello") ? "a greeting!" : "something else")</p>

<!-- Multi-statement block -->
@{
    var greeting = "Welcome to our site!";
    var weekDay = DateTime.Now.DayOfWeek;
    var greetingMessage = greeting + " Today is: " + weekDay;
}
<p>The greeting is: @greetingMessage</p>
```

#### HTML encoding
> :exclamation: For security reasons, content displayed in a page using the `@` character will be HTML-encoded, replacing reserved HTML characters (such as `<` and `>` and `&`) with codes that enable them to be displayed *as characters* in a web page instead of being interpreted as HTML tags or entities.

To output HTML markup that renders tags *as markup*, use the [HTML helper method](#html-helper-methods) **`Html.Raw`**:

```c#
@{ var description = "<p>Final issue! Even if Spider-Man survives... <strong>will Peter Parker?</strong></p>"; }

<div>@Html.Raw(description)</div>
```

#### Combining control flow & markup
Given the following variables:
```c#
@{
    var seriesTitle = "The Amazing Spider-Man";
    var artists = new string[]
    {
        "Script: Dan Slott",
        "Pencils: Humberto Ramos",
        "Inks: Victor Olazaba",
        "Colors: Edgar Delgado",
        "Letters: Chris Eliopoulos"
    };
}
```
...you can combine conditionals & loops with the markup as follows:
```c#
<div>
    <h1>@seriesTitle</h1>

    @if (artists.Length > 0)
    {
        <h5>Artists:</h5>
        <ul>
            @foreach (string artist in artists)
            {
                <li>@artist</li>
            }
        </ul>
    }
</div>
```

### Layout
The [`_Layout.cshtml`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-pages/overview/ui-layouts-and-themes/3-creating-a-consistent-look) file provides the overall look and feel for every page on our website, without having to repeat the related markup in each view - for example, header and footer markup. 
> :bulb: *Typically, websites contain just a single layout page, but it is possible to have more than one layout page.*

The **`@RenderBody`** method can be used in the layout file to indicate where the content for the view requested by the user should be included (i.e. the content for each individual page). This method can only be called once from a layout page.

#### Hooking up the Layout with specific Views
##### > Option 1: per View
In each View file, the layout to be used with a page is indicated as follows:
```c#
@{
    Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
}
```

##### > Option 2: all Views
By convention, MVC will execute any code in the **`~/Views/_ViewStart.cshtml`** at the start of each View’s rendering. So by placing the above code in this file, the layout will be rendered for all Views, without referencing it in them individually.


### HTML helper methods
Used in MVC views to generate markup

- `@Html.Raw(myVariable)` - outputs the content of `myVariable` unencoded; see [earlier example](#html-encoding)
- `@Html.ActionLink()` - generates a text based link; for example: `@Html.ActionLink("Return to Index", "Index", null, new { @class = "btn btn-default" })` will result in the HTML:
    ```html
    <a class="btn btn-default" href="/">Return to Index</a>
    ```
    
- `@Url.Action()` - generates a URL string - can be used in an anchor tag's `href` attribute to dynamicaly generate links around non-text items - see example below for differences between the two link helper methods:

```cshtml
@model ComicBookGallery.Models.ComicBook[]

<h2>Comic Books</h2>
@foreach (var comicBook in Model)
{
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-3">
            <h4>@Html.ActionLink(comicBook.DisplayText, "Detail", new { id = comicBook.Id })</h4>
            <a href="@Url.Action("Detail", new { id = comicBook.Id })">
                <img src="/Images/@comicBook.CoverImageFileName"
                     alt="@comicBook.DisplayText"
                     class="img-responsive" />
            </a>
        </div>
    </div>
}
```

### Functions
The purpose of a `@functions` block is to wrap up reusable code, like methods and properties, and then be able to call those methods or properties from other parts of the page.

###### Declaring functions and properties:
```C#
@functions {
    int userAge = 0;
    string HelloMessage(string user)
    {
        return "Hi " + user + ", how are you?";
    }
    
    int Age
    {
        get { return userAge; }
        set { userAge = value; }
    }
}
```

###### Using declared functions and properties on the page:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" />
    </head>
    <body>
        @{
            Age = 27; // In a real page, you might retrieve the user's age from a form or database
        }
        <p>The value of the <code>HelloMessage</code> method: @HelloMessage("James")</p>   
        <p>The value of the <code>Age</code> property: @Age.ToString()</p>    
    </body>
</html>
```

### The Request object
You'll often work with the `Request` object, which gives you information like the values of text boxes (form fields) on the page (see [example below](#reading-user-input)), what type of browser made the request, the URL of the page, the user identity, etc. 

The following example shows how to access properties of the `Request` object and how to call the `MapPath()` method of the Request object, which gives you the absolute path of the page on the server:

```html
<table border="1">
<tr>
    <td>Requested URL</td>
    <td>Relative Path</td>
    <td>Full Path</td>
    <td>HTTP Request Type</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>@Request.Url</td>
    <td>@Request.FilePath</td>
    <td>@Request.MapPath(Request.FilePath)</td>
    <td>@Request.RequestType</td>
</tr>
</table>
```

The result displayed in a browser:

![Request object props](/img/request-object-properties.PNG)

#### Reading user input
An important feature of dynamic web pages is that you can read user input. In Razor, input is read via `Request["input-name"]`, and posting input is tested by the `IsPost` condition:

```c#
@{
    var totalMessage = "";
    if (IsPost)
    {
        var num1 = Request["text1"];
        var num2 = Request["text2"];
        var total = num1.AsInt() + num2.AsInt();
        totalMessage = "Total = " + total;
    }
}
<form action="" method="post">
    <p>
        <label for="text1">First Number:</label><br>
        <input type="text" name="text1" />
    </p>
    <p>
        <label for="text2">Second Number:</label><br>
        <input type="text" name="text2" />
    </p>
    <p><input type="submit" value=" Add " /></p>
</form>
<p>@totalMessage</p>
```

### HttpContext
`HttpContext` can be used to [access the HTTP context](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-context?view=aspnetcore-2.2) from Razor pages:

```C#
@{
    var numberOfCatsRequested = Context.Request.Query["cat-quantity"];
}
```

NB: it can also be accessed from [tag helpers](#tag-helpers), controllers, models, or any custom code or middleware.

## Bundling & Minification
Bundling and minification are two techniques used to improve request load time. Bundling and minification improve load time by reducing the number of requests to the server and reducing the size of requested assets (such as CSS and JavaScript.)

Most of the current major browsers limit the number of simultaneous connections per each hostname to six. That means that while six requests are being processed, additional requests for assets on a host will be queued by the browser, so if your website is comprised of a great number of `.html`/`.css`/`.js` files, this will significantly impair page load time.

- **Bundling** allows you to combine (bundle) multiple files into a single file.
    - You can create CSS, JavaScript and other bundles. 
    - Fewer files means fewer HTTP requests and that can improve first page load performance.
- **Minification** performs a variety of different code optimizations to scripts or css, such as removing unnecessary white space and comments and shortening variable names to one character. 


### Webpack
***NB: Most modern day projects tend to use WebPack*** instead of ASP.NET's built in bundler. Webpack essentially does the same thing, but works better with UI frameworks such as Angular, React etc.

For more details, refer to:
- [How to use Webpack in ASP.Net core projects](https://codeburst.io/how-to-use-webpack-in-asp-net-core-projects-a-basic-react-template-sample-25a3681a5fc2)


### ASP.NET bundler
Since ASP.NET 4.5, it comes with its own bundler.

**To enable ASP.NET bundling & minification**, set the value of the `debug` attribute in the `compilation` element in the *Web.config* file to `false`:
```xml
<system.web>
    <compilation debug="false" />
    <!-- Lines removed for clarity. -->
</system.web>
```
Alternatively, you can enable bundling & minification with the `EnableOptimizations` property on the `BundleTable` class - NB this will override the Web.config setting:
```c#
public static void RegisterBundles(BundleCollection bundles)
{
    bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/jquery").Include(
                 "~/Scripts/jquery-{version}.js"));

    // Code removed for clarity.
    BundleTable.EnableOptimizations = true;
}
```

**NB:** Minified files have *.min.* in the file name, e.g.: *FileX.min.js*

A ***BundleConfig.cs*** file will be created in any new ASP.NET MVC project (the default location for this is *App\_Start\BundleConfig.cs*).

Use the `RegisterBundles` method to define any new bundles, and rules for the sources they should be created from, for example:
```c#
public static void RegisterBundles(BundleCollection bundles)
{
     bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/jquery").Include(
                 "~/Scripts/jquery-{version}.js"));
         // Code removed for clarity.
}
```
- This creates a new JavaScript bundle named "`~/bundles/jquery`" that includes all the appropriate files in the Scripts folder that match the wild card string "~/Scripts/jquery-{version}.js".
- The `Bundle` class' `Include()` method takes an array of strings, where each string is a virtual path to a resource. 
- A range of other methods exist, for example `IncludeDirectory()` to add all the files in a directory (and optionally all subdirectories) which match a search pattern.

**Bundles are referenced in views using the `Render()` method**, (`Styles.Render()` for CSS and `Scripts.Render()` for JavaScript). The following markup from the *Views\Shared\_Layout.cshtml* file shows how the default ASP.NET internet project views reference CSS and JavaScript bundles.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    @* Markup removed for clarity.*@    
    @Styles.Render("~/Content/themes/base/css", "~/Content/css")
    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/modernizr")
</head>
<body>
    @* Markup removed for clarity.*@
   
    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/jquery")
    @RenderSection("scripts", required: false)
</body>
</html>
```
 
- The Render methods takes an array of strings, so you can add multiple bundles in one line of code.
- The bundle names need to match the ones created in the *BundleConfig.cs*.

## Tag Helpers
Tag Helpers enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files.

- There are many built-in Tag Helpers for common tasks - such as creating forms, links, loading assets and more - and even more available in public GitHub repositories and as NuGet packages.
    - Example: The built-in `ImageTagHelper` can append a version number to the image name. Whenever the image changes, the server generates a new unique version for the image, so clients are guaranteed to get the current image (instead of a stale cached image).
- Tag Helpers are authored in C#, and they *target HTML elements* based on element name, attribute name, or parent tag, and can provide server-side attributes for the element.

For the most part, Razor markup using Tag Helpers looks like standard HTML. A rich IntelliSense environment helps create and navigate HTML and Razor markup.

> :bulb: Conceptually, Tag Helpers are very similar to AngularJS directives.

#### How it works
The Razor View Engine scans for valid Tag Helpers on any given Razor view page (it can identify them because they implement the `ITagHelper` interface, typically by inheriting from the `TagHelper` class). When it finds one, it calls its `Process()` method.

### Built-in Tag Helpers



### Building your own Tag Helpers
Custom Tag Helpers need to implement [the abstract base class `TagHelper`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.razor.taghelpers.taghelper?view=aspnetcore-2.2).

Custom Tag Helpers work by overriding the **`Process()`** (or `ProcessAsync()`) method. This method has two parameters that fully describe the tag itself - `TagHelperOutput output` - and the environment it is run in - `TagHelperContext context`. *All the work to update the omitted HTML is done in this method.*

> Use `ProcessAsync()` for any logic that would benefit from being run asynchronously (e.g. that involves DB or web server calls that could otherwise cause blocking) - otherwise use `Process()`.

The custom tag helper class can be decorated with the `HtmlTargetElement` attribute, which allows for the tag helper to explicitely target a given HTML element, and to define attributes for that tag helper element.

All of the above in an example:

```C#
[HtmlTargetElement("my-customer", Attributes = "name")]
public class MyCustomerTagHelper : TagHelper
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }

        public override void Process(TagHelperContext context, TagHelperOutput output)
        {
            output.Content.SetHtmlContent("Hello, " + Name); //sets the output HTML
            output.TagName = "strong"; //changes the tag of the targeted element from <my-customer> to <strong>
        }
    }
```

-> In the Razor page, this tag helper would be referenced like so:
```html
<my-customer name="Igor"></my-customer>
```

-> The resulting output HTML would be:
```html
<strong>Hello, Igor</strong>
```

##### :bulb: Alternatively, attributes can also be declared via the property directly:
```c#
[HtmlAttributeName("name")]
public string Name { get; set; }
```

> Even without any of these decorators, attributes of the HTML tag targetted by the tag helper would always be implicitely bound to the public properties of a matching name. To declare a public property in the tag helper that isn't tied up with a HTML attribute from the Razor page, you can mark the property with the `[HTMLAttributeNotBound]` attribute.
