## Overview
Most if not all frontend frameworks use **templating** in some way or other, and most are influenced by the [MVC pattern](#mvc-pattern-recap) in splitting views, data and controllers into separate concerns.

The framework landscape has also been shaped by varying approaches to [where the HTML should be rendered in the first place](#server-side-vs-client-side-rendering), resulting in the availability of both [server-side and client-side frameworks](#frontend-vs-backend-frameworks). Most [client-side frameworks](#frontend-frameworks-compared) extend the idea of [AJAX](#the-role-of-ajax) for communicating with a server without updating the page, and share the concept of **data binding** (establishing a connection between a piece of data and a template) for dynamically updating a page.


## MVC pattern recap
The *Model View Controller* design pattern is commonly used across many frameworks for front end development.

- **Model** = the *data* in your website. The application's data domain is implemented through *model objects*. Model objects often retrieve and store model state in a database. For example, a Product object might retrieve information from a database, operate on it, and then write updated information back to a Products table in a SQL Server database.

- **View** = the components that display the application's *user interface (UI)*. Typically, this UI is created from the model data. (An example would be an edit view of a Products table that displays text boxes, drop-down lists, and check boxes based on the current state of a Product object.)

- **Controller** = the *coordinator* that processes a request and is responsible for directing what specific actions need to be performed when a user navigates to the website, in order to send a response to that user. Controllers are the components that handle user interaction, select a view to render in the UI and work with the model to decide what data should be sent to the view.

In an MVC application, the view only displays information; the controller handles and responds to user input and interaction. For example, the controller handles query-string values, and passes these values to the model, which in turn might use these values to query the database.

The MVC pattern helps create applications that separate the different aspects of the application: input logic (controller), business logic (model), and UI logic (view), while providing a loose coupling between these elements.

## Server-side vs client-side rendering

[Razor](/MVC-and-Razor.md#razor--mvc) renders the HTML on the server, whereas [Angular(JS)](/Angular-Notes.md) renders it on the client.
There's a whole debate about which of these are better, and modern web development is split into two camps:

***Camp 1*** uses server-side technologies for its controllers and views and has JavaScript in its views for dynamic things.
- [MVC and Razor](/MVC-and-Razor.md) are the ASP.NET server-side technologies used for this.
- Other server-side technologies for this approach include: Express (Javascript), Django (Python) and Rails (Ruby)
- Client-side technologies may include things like [jQuery](/Javascript-and-the-DOM.md#jquery) or Dojo.

***Camp 2*** uses server-side technologies to expose REST endpoints. Client-side technologies are used to provide controllers and views.
- WebAPI is one ASP.NET server-side technology used for this.
- See [below](#server-side-vs-client-side-frameworks) for a list of client-side JS frameworks.

### How to choose?
*Client-side rendering* essentially means that the entire application is loaded into the browser that the user is using. There are many performance and user experience benefits to client-side frameworks, as follow-up requests to the server will only be for small amounts of data, rather than more HTML & CSS files as is the case with traditional web pages.

One consideration for deciding between a client- or server-side framework is that for applications with a **large amount of dynamic elements**, you don't want to have to call back to the server every time you want to render some new HTML. Any functionality that requires an **interactive UI without page refreshes** (i.e. a list to which you add items without a page reload, or a form where the fields defined are dependent on each other) would be best served by a client side framework.

On the other hand, server-side rendering more easily achieves important **SEO benefits** - see [this article](https://medium.com/@benjburkholder/javascript-seo-server-side-rendering-vs-client-side-rendering-bc06b8ca2383) for more detail.


## Frontend vs backend frameworks

| Frontend FWs (all JS)              | Backend FWs             |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| [Angular](https://angular.io/)     | Django, Flask (Python)  |
| [AngularJS](Angular-Notes.md)      | NodeJS, Expess (JS)     |
| [Ember](https://www.emberjs.com/)  | Spring, JSF (Java)      |
| [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) | ASP.NET MVC / Core (C#) |
| [React](https://reactjs.org/)      | Rails, Sinatra (Ruby)   |
| [Vue.js](Vue-JS-Notes.md)          |                         |

## The role of AJAX
- [AJAX](https://github.com/minkaotic/front-end-notes/blob/master/AJAX-Notes.md) allows us to get data from a server without the need to refresh a webpage.

- Client-side frameworks like Angular extend this idea. Even though the entire application is loaded into the browser when a user requests a URL, in most cases the application will make additional requests for data back to the server via an AJAX call.

- These requests will not re-send the files to the client, but just the pure data - most of the time the response will be in JSON.

- The client-side app can also send data back to the server. This dual capability is known as **"[two-way data binding](/Angular-Notes.md#data-binding)"**.
